$-Code, Setting, Units, Setting Description
0,X-axis travel resolution,step/mm,X-axis travel resolution in steps per millimeter.
1,Y-axis travel resolution,step/mm,Y-axis travel resolution in steps per millimeter.
2,Z-axis travel resolution,step/mm,Z-axis travel resolution in steps per millimeter.
3,Step pulse time,microseconds,Sets time length per step.
4,Default feed rates,mm/min,This setting sets the default seek rates (G0) after Grbl powers on and initializes
5,Default seek rates,mm/min,This setting sets the default feed rates(G1 G2 G3) after Grbl powers on and initializes
6,Step port invert mask,int:00000000,Inverts the step signal.
7,step idle delay,msec,Sets a short hold delay when stopping to let dynamics settle before disabling steppers. Value 255 keeps motors enabled with no delay.
8,acceleration,mm/sec^2,Used for motion planning to not exceed motor torque and lose steps.
9,junction deviation,mm,Sets how fast Grbl travels through consecutive motions. Lower value slows it down.
10,arc,mm/segment,
11,n-arc correction,int,This is an advanced setting that shouldn't be changed unless there are circumstances that you need to.
12,n-decimals,int,Set how many decimal places all of the floating point values Grbl reports.
13,report inches,bool,Enables inch units when returning any position and rate value that is not a settings value.
14,auto start,bool,
15,invert step enable,bool,
16,hard limits,bool,
17,homing cycle,bool,
18,homing dir invert mask,int:00000000,
19,homing feed,mm/min,
20,homing seek,mm/min,
21,homing debounce,msec,
22,homing pull-off,mm,
